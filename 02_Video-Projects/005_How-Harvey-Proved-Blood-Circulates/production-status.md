## STOP

- **Script below 90.** v01 scores 84.4. Ben either passes it by hand (as for 004 at 88.9) or asks for a v02. No VO until then.
- **vidIQ audit and title** need Ben's login and OK.

`neighbours.py "blood circulation" "william harvey" "how the heart pumps blood" --phrase blood --phrase heart --manifest …`: gate PASS, 8 big neighbours, TED-Ed yes; block written to `PACKAGE_MANIFEST.json`.

`npm run lint:package -- --film 005`

```

Note: the gate first read the audit as signed because its "Signed off by" pattern accepted the words "pending Ben" as a name. The line is now an em dash, so the gate reports it honestly. The gate's pattern itself is unchanged; any fix to it needs its own PR with Ben's OK.
